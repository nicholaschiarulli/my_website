## Quick Overview

- Methodological subject encompassing all aspects of learning from data

- Statisticians apply and develop data analysis methods, seek to understand their properties

- Researchers and workers apply and extend statistical methodology and contribute new ideas and methods for conducting data analysis

## A "Statistic" and the field of "Statistics"

- A **statistic** ~ numerical or graphical summary of a collection of data.

  - Average score on final exam
  - Minimum temperature at a location over year
  - Proportion of people who are retired

- **Statistics** ~ academic discipline focusing on research methodology. Statisticians develop new statistical tools, calculate statistics from data, and collaborate with subject-matter experts to interpret them.

## The Landscape of Statistics

Evolving and dynamic field ~ Emerging challenges and opportunities

- Properties of statistical methods are under continuing study

- New application areas -> development of new analytic methods

- New types of sensors -> new types of data

- Advances in computing -> sophisticated analyses on Big Data

## Perspective on Statistical Science

Statistics is a "big tent" discipline ~ incorporates new ideas from theory, practice, allied fields.

Different Perspectives:

- art of summarizing data
- science of uncertainty
- science of decisions
- science of variation
- art of forecasting
- science of measurement
- basis for principled data collection

## art of summarizing data

- Data can be overwhelming
- Making sense of data usually involves reduction and summarization

## science of uncertainty

- Data can be misleading
- Statistics provides framework for assessing whether claims based on data are meaningful
- Uncertainty is inevitable, but is highly desirable to quantify how far our reported findings may fall from "the truth"

## science of decisions

- Understanding data is important -> only consequential if we cat on what we have learned
- Decision-making = ultimate goal of any statistical analysis
- We make decisions in face of uncertainty! What are the costs and benefits of different approaches?

## science of variation

- Often focus on most typical or "central" value
- Great emphasis on understanding variation in data

## art of forecasting

- Forecasting or prediction = central tasks in statistics
- **Cannot** know future with absolute certainty, but efficient use of available data **can** sometimes make accurate predictions about future

## science of measurement

- High accuracy: person's age or height
- More difficult: blood pressure (varies minute to minute)
- Harder: "mood", "political ideology", "personality"

Statistics: major role in constructing and evaluating rigorous approaches for measuring difficult-to-define concepts and in assessing quality

## basis for principled data collection

- Data is often expensive and difficult to collect
- Resource limitations -> collect least data as possible

Statistics provides a rational way to manage this trade-off

## Statistics and its allied fields

- Computer science: algorithms, data structures for working with data, programming languages for manipulating data.

- Mathematics: language and notation for expressing statistical concepts concisely, tools for understanding properties of statistical methods.

- Probability theory: branch of mathematics ~ crucial part of foundations of statistics - to express ideas about randomness and uncertainty.

- Data Science: database management, machine learning, computational infrastructure to carry out data analysis.
