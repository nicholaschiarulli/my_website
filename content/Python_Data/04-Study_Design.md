## Study Design in Various Fields

- Clinical trials for drugs and other medical treatments
- Reliability and quality-assurance studies for manufactured products
- Observable studies for human health
- Public pinion and other surveys
- Studies involving administrative and other incidental data
- Market research studies
- Agriculture field trials

## Types of Research Studies

- Exploratory versus Confirmatory studies
- Comparative versus Non-Comparative studies
- Observational studies versus Experiments

## Exploratory versus Confirmatory studies

- Exploratory: Collect and analyze data without first pre-specifying the question

- Confirmatory: Scientific method ~ specify falsifiable hypothesis, then test it -> collect data to address single pre-specified question

**CAUTION**: Informative but watch out for "overfitting", "multiple testing" and "p-hacking"

The more questions you ask from a dataset -> the more likely you are to draw a misleading conclusion

## Comparative studies

Goal: Contrast one quantity to another

Examples:

- Yields of oranges in plots of land treated with different fertilizers
- Preference of voters for one candidate or another
- Rates at which viewers will click on two different versions of an online ad

## Non-Comparative studies

Focus = estimating or predicting absolute quantities ~ not (explicitly) comparative

Examples:

- Predicting stock
- Measure value of blood pressure after treatment from certain drug

## Observational Data

Arise "naturally", contrasts based on "self-selection" of units into groups

## Experiments

Involve manipulation or assignment -> experimenter deliberately treats different units in different ways

## Observational Study

Example:

- Compare lung cancer rates in smokers and non-smokers
- Compare standardized test scores in classrooms with teachers with more and less experience teaching

## Experimental Study

Example:

- Compare yields of lettuce in fields treated with and without fertilizer
- Whether people are more like;y to click on different versions of same ad

## Implications of Experimental/Observational Design

Experiments often involve random assignment of subjects to "treatment arms"

Observational Studies often say subjects are "exposed" to a condition rather than being "assigned"

## Power and Bias

- Power Analysis: Process to assess whether given study design likely to yield meaningful findings

- Bias: Measurements that are systematically off-target, or sample is not representative of population of interest. (Observational studies are especially vulnerable)
