## Quantitative Variables

- Numerical, measurable quantities in which arithmetic operations often make sense

- Continuous - could take on any value within an interval, many possible values

  - Time to complete Homework
  - BMI

- Discrete - countable value, finite number of values

## Categorical (or Qualitative) Variables

- Ordinal - groups have an order or ranking

  - Class ranking (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior)

- Nominal - groups are merely names, no ranking
  - Race

    (Moving around the data doesn't change it)
